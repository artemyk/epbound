# Bound entropy production using convex optimization

Based on Appendix D of the following:

* A Kolchinsky and DH Wolpert, ``Entropy production given constraints on the energy functions''.

The example shown in Figure 4 (particle diffusing on a 2D lattice) is analyzed in `lattice.py`.

Requires Python 3.5 or later and `cvxpy`.
